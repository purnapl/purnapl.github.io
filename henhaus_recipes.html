<h1 > <center> The Henhaus Cookbook </center> </h1>
<p> The approximate recipes for the best dinners (and a few other things) that I made over the past year. I know you guys don't like cooking as much as I do, but I thought you might like to try some of these! I'm going to really miss cooking for all of us. </p>

<h2>Pelmeni </h2>
<p> <i> From momsdish.com pelmeni recipe</i> </p>
<p> </p>

<p> <i>Dough </i>
<br>3 cups flour
<br>2/3 cup lukewarm water
<br>3 eggs
<br>1 teaspoon salt
</p>

<p><i>Filling</i>
<br>2 pounds ground beef
<br>1 large onion, grated
<br>1-2 teaspoons salt
<br>Pepper
</p>

<p><i>Topping</i>
<br>¼ cup siracha
<br>¼ cup white vinegar
<br>Butter
<br>Sour cream
<br>Curry powder
</p>

<p>Make the dough: combine all ingredients in a bowl and knead into a smooth dough. Cover with a damp towel or plastic bag and set aside at room temperature for at least 30 minutes.</p>

<p>Make the filling: combine all ingredients in a large bowl and mix well. Refrigerate while you let the dough rest.</p>

<p>When the dough is done resting, roll it out dough very thin (less than 1/8 of an inch). Cut out circles about 2-3 inches in diameter using a jar. Put a spoonful of filling in the middle, wet the edges, and fold over to create a half-circle. Connect the ends of the half moon to shape the pelmeni. </p>

<p>Cook the pelmeni in lightly salted simmering water; the pelmeni are cooked when they float to the surface (but you can cook them an extra 30 seconds to 1 minute after they float to the surface to be sure they are cooked). </p>

<p>Mix siracha and white vinegar together. Top pelmeni with a little bit of butter, curry powder, siracha-vinegar sauce, and sour cream. </p>

<h2>Eggplant Parmesan </h2>
<p></p>

<p>2-3 large eggplants
<br>Salt
<br>2 eggs, whisked with a few tablespoons of water
<br>Flour
<br>Breadcrumbs or panko
<br>Garlic powder
<br>Oregano, thyme, rosemary, sage, or a combination of all three, finely chopped or crushed
<br>Cayenne
<br>Parmesan
<br>Vegetable oil
<br>1 container ricotta
<br>Mozzarella, grated or finely chopped
</p>

<p>Slice eggplants thinly (1/8-1/4 inch thick) crosswise. Place eggplant circles in a single layer on cutting board or baking tray and sprinkle salt over them.
  Let sit at least 15 minutes, flip, and salt the other side. Let sit another 15 minutes, then rinse thoroughly. Dry off with a towel. </p>

<p>Heat about ½ inch vegetable oil in a frying pan. Mix breadcrumbs, crushed herbs, garlic powder, pepper, and parmesan. Dip each eggplant slice in flour.
  Shake off, then dip in egg and again in breadcrumb mixture. Fry until lightly brown on each side. Set aside.</p>

<p>Once all eggplant slices are fried, place them in single layer on the bottom of an oiled pan. Mix ricotta, crushed spices, garlic powder, pepper, parmesan, and salt.
  Spread ricotta mixture on top of eggplant slices in pan, add another layer of eggplant slices on top, and add a layer of tomato sauce on top of the eggplant.
  Repeat the layers: eggplant, ricotta, eggplant, tomato sauce, until you are out of eggplant slices. On top of the final layer of eggplant, add tomato sauce, mozzarella, parmesan, and herbs.
  Bake at 425F until the top is crispy, and serve alongside pasta.</p>
