<p> <a href = "https://www.pdx.edu/digital-city/smart-trees">The Smart Trees Project</a> is a collaboration between researchers at Reed College, Portland State University, Washington State University-Vancouver, The Nature Conservancy, and the US Forest Service
   that aims to track how the health of urban trees in the Portland Metropolitan Area varies with tree height, temperature, humidity, shade, elevation, and proximity to roads and urban centers. </p>
   <p> </p>

<h2> Why is it important to study urban trees?</h2>
<p> </p>
<p> Trees in cities provide many essential functions: They provide shade on hot, sunny days; lower air temperatures through both shade and evaporative cooling since their leaves contain lots of moisture;
  and provide windbreaks. They aesthetically improve areas where they are planted, and can increase residential property values substantially. <a href="https://www.state.sc.us/forest/urbben.htm"><sup>2</sup></a> </p>
  It is important that we monitor the health of our urban trees so that we can make sure to care for them as they care for us.
  <p> </p>
  <p> Trees in urban areas tend to be exposed to warmer temperatures in both the summer and the winter because the pavement in cities absorbs heat, a phenomenon known as the urban heat island effect.
  These temperature differences can be substantial, with daytime temperatures generally about 1-7ºF (0.5-4ºC) higher and nighttime temperatures 2-5ºF (1-3ºC) higher in cities than in nearby rural areas.<a href="https://www.epa.gov/heat-islands/"><sup>2</sup></a>
  Different cities have different temperature gradients for multiple reasons, including city size, regional climate, topography, surface colors (darker pavement and roofing materials absorb more heat), building materials,
  city geometry (where building are placed can affect airflow, which can affect cooling), and presence or absence of parks. <a href="https://www.epa.gov/heatislands/learn-about-heat-islands"><sup>3</sup></a>
  In areas with more trees and parkland, the effects of urban heat islands tend to be lessened, as the evaporative cooling and shade provided by plants helps to reduce temperatures.
  However, the warmer temperatures in urban areas can be harmful to the trees that are planted there, as many species native to the region are not adapted to substantially warmer city temperatures.
  Different tree species are impacted differently by warmer temperatures, too, and other factors can affect how even trees in the same species respond to the increased temperatures caused by urban heat islands.
  As the climate gets even warmer, the effects of urban heat islands are expected to increase; at the same time, urban heat islands also contribute to the global warming effect.<a href="https://science2017.globalchange.gov/chapter/10/"><sup>4</sup></a>
  Understanding the impacts of the urban heat island effect on native trees in Portland can therefore tell us both how our urban trees are doing with the temperatures we have today, and how more rural trees can expect to fare as the climate warms.
  <p> </p>
  <h2> Why exactly does the Smart Trees Project do?</h2>
  <p> </p>
<p>To address the question of how trees native to the Pacific Northwest are responding to warmer urban temperatures, we have installed equipment that allows us to monitor different aspects of tree health at a few different sites along an urban-to-rural gradient in and outside of Portland.
  We have several sites along this gradient, including a "warm-urban" site in suburban Southeast Portland, a "cool-urban" site at Powell Butte, and a "cool-rural site" near Sandy, OR.
  In the past year, we have mainly focused on the health of the tree species Douglas-fir (<i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i>), a widespread and important forestry tree in the Pacific Northwest.
  We are now beginning to branch out (pun intended) our study into exploring the health of two other native tree species as well, Western Red Cedar (<i>Thuja plicata</i>) and Bigleaf Maple (<i>Acer macrophyllum</i>). </p>

<p> At each site, we monitor the climate conditions (temperature and humidity) at different heights within the tree canopy. Douglas-fir, one of the tallest tree species in the world, is particularly well-suited for this.
    We installed temperature and humidity loggers on one tree at each site. One of the loggers was placed at the height of the lowest branches, and one was placed as close to the top of the tree as possible.
    This allows us to see if there are any differences in temperature and humidity between the lower and top parts of the tree, which could affect the health of different parts of the tree.
    These loggers record climate data every 10 minutes. That's a lot of data! But this climate data doesn't tell us anything about the actual health of the trees.
    To understand how the trees' health corresponds to the climate of each site, we also directly collect data on the physiological health of the trees.
    A measurement called water potential allows us to see how drought-stressed the trees are at a given point in time. Once a month, we collect water potential data on trees at every site.
    This allows us to see the relationship between temperature, humidity, and drought stress in our trees. If we understand this relationship, we can better predict how warming temperatures might affect these trees in the future, too.
    Another tree health measurement, called a vulnerbility curve, allows us to understand how drought <i>adapted</i> the trees are.
    It tells us how much drought the trees can experience and still be able to perform their neccessary physiological functions, like moving water from their roots to their leaves so photosynthesis can occur.
    Because it's more difficult for taller trees to move water from their roots to their leaves (it's a lot further!), we are also interested in differences in the water potential and vulnerbility curve data between "shorter" 100-foot Douglas-fir trees and the "taller" 200-foot Douglas-fir trees.
    We also compare the water potential data for the lowest part of each tree's branches and the tallest part (that we can reach) of each tree's branches.
    That way we can understand the potential effects of both tree height and sample collection height on the drought health of the trees, and how the urban-ness of each site might affect trees of different heights differently. </p>
