  <p> I'm a first-year PhD student in biology with an emphasis in ecology, evolution, and organismal biology at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City.
  My research focuses on plant ecophysiology, the intersection between plants and their environment. Specifically, I am interested in better understanding how anthropogenic drought and wildfire will impact the forests of the future. </p>

  <h2> Current Research </h2>
</div>
  <p> Trees in cities provide many essential functions: They provide shade on hot, sunny days; lower air temperatures through both shade and evaporative cooling since their leaves contain lots of moisture;
    and provide windbreaks. They aesthetically improve areas where they are planted, and can increase residential property values substantially.<a href="https://www.state.sc.us/forest/urbben.htm" style="color:#870400; text-decoration:none;" ><sup>1</sup></a>
    It is important that we monitor the health of our urban trees so that we can make sure to care for them as they care for us.</p>

<div class="header2">
  <h2>What Challenges Do Urban Trees Face?</h2>
</div>
    <p> Trees in urban areas tend to be exposed to warmer temperatures in both the summer and the winter because the pavement in cities absorbs heat, a phenomenon known as the urban heat island effect.
    These temperature differences can be substantial, with daytime temperatures generally about 1-7ºF (0.5-4ºC) higher and nighttime temperatures 2-5ºF (1-3ºC) higher in cities than in nearby rural areas.<a href="https://www.epa.gov/heat-islands/" style="color:#870400; text-decoration:none;"><sup>2</sup></a>
    Different cities have different temperature gradients for multiple reasons, including city size, regional climate, topography, surface colors (darker pavement and roofing materials absorb more heat), building materials,
    city geometry (where building are placed can affect airflow, which can affect cooling), and presence or absence of parks.<a href="https://www.epa.gov/heatislands/learn-about-heat-islands" style="color:#870400; text-decoration:none;"><sup>3</sup></a>
    In areas with more trees and parkland, the effects of urban heat islands tend to be lessened, as the evaporative cooling and shade provided by plants helps to reduce temperatures.
    However, the warmer temperatures in urban areas can be harmful to the trees that are planted there, as many species native to the region are not adapted to substantially warmer city temperatures.
    Different tree species are impacted differently by warmer temperatures, too, and other factors can affect how even trees in the same species respond to the increased temperatures caused by urban heat islands.
    As the climate gets even warmer, the effects of urban heat islands are expected to increase; at the same time, urban heat islands also contribute to the global warming effect.<a href="https://science2017.globalchange.gov/chapter/10/" style="color:#870400; text-decoration:none;"><sup>4</sup></a>
    Understanding the impacts of the urban heat island effect on native trees in Portland can therefore tell us both how our urban trees are doing with the temperatures we have today, and how more rural trees can expect to fare as the climate warms. </p>

<div class="header2">
    <h2> What Does The Smart Trees Project Do?</h2>
</div>
  <p>To address the question of how trees native to the Pacific Northwest are responding to warmer urban temperatures, we have installed equipment that allows us to monitor different aspects of tree health at a few different sites along an urban-to-rural gradient in and outside of Portland.
    We have several sites along this gradient, including a "warm-urban" site in suburban Southeast Portland, a "cool-urban" site at Powell Butte, and a "cool-rural site" near Sandy, OR.
    In the past year, we have mainly focused on the health of the tree species Douglas-fir (<i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i>), a widespread and important forestry tree in the Pacific Northwest.
    We are now beginning to branch out (pun intended) our study into exploring the health of two other native tree species as well, Western Red Cedar (<i>Thuja plicata</i>) and Bigleaf Maple (<i>Acer macrophyllum</i>). </p>

<div class="header2">
        <h2> What Type Of Data Do We Collect?</h2>
</div>
<p> At each site, we monitor the climate conditions (temperature and humidity) at different heights within the tree canopy. Douglas-fir, one of the tallest tree species in the world, is particularly well-suited for this.
    We installed temperature and humidity loggers on one tree at each site. One of the loggers was placed at the height of the lowest branches, and one was placed as close to the top of the tree as possible.
    This allows us to see if there are any differences in temperature and humidity between the lower and top parts of the tree, which could affect the health of different parts of the tree.
    These loggers record climate data every 10 minutes. That's a lot of data! But this climate data doesn't tell us anything about the actual health of the trees.
    To understand how the trees' health corresponds to the climate of each site, we also directly collect data on the physiological health of the trees.
    A measurement called water potential allows us to see how drought-stressed the trees are at a given point in time. Once a month, we collect water potential data on trees at every site.
    This allows us to see the relationship between temperature, humidity, and drought stress in our trees. If we understand this relationship, we can better predict how warming temperatures might affect these trees in the future, too.
    Another tree health measurement, called a vulnerability curve, allows us to understand how drought-<i>adapted</i> the trees are.
    It tells us how much drought the trees can experience and still be able to perform their neccessary physiological functions, like moving water from their roots to their leaves so photosynthesis can occur.
    Because it's more difficult for taller trees to move water from their roots to their leaves (it's a lot further!), we are also interested in differences in the water potential and vulnerbility curve data between "shorter" 100-foot Douglas-fir trees and the "taller" 200-foot Douglas-fir trees.
    We also compare the water potential data for the lowest part of each tree's branches and the tallest part (that we can reach) of each tree's branches.
    That way we can understand the potential effects of both tree height and sample collection height on the drought health of the trees, and how the urban-ness of each site might affect trees of different heights differently. </p>

<p> Hi, I'm Purna. I graduated in 2020 from Reed College with a BA in Biology and I'm now pursuing a PhD in Biology at the University of Utah. My interests include ecology, botany, journalism, and science communication. </p>

<h2>Research Experience </h2>
<p> </p>
<p> I'm currently working with Dr. Aaron Ramirez, Assistant Professor of Biology at Reed College, to publish some of the work done on bigcone Douglas-fir (<i>Pseudotsuga macrocarpa</i>) by myself and others in the Ramirez Lab in summer 2018.
  Stay tuned for for more specifics on the upcoming papers!
<p> </p>
<p>As a senior at Reed College, I spent two semesters working with Dr. Ramirez
  to design and carry out an experimental undergraduate thesis. My thesis explored whether three species of trees native to the Pacific
  Northwest (Douglas-fir (<i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i>), Bigleaf Maple (<i>Acer macrophyllum</i>), and Coast Redwood (<i>Sequoia sempervirens</i>))
  are capable of absorbing water through their bark in order to reduce drought stress. If you're at all interested in my thesis work, you can read my
  thesis <a href="thesis.pdf"> here.</a> </p>
<p></p>
<p>I worked in the forestry department of the University of Göttingen, Germany, for 12 weeks in summer 2019. My internship with PhD student Amani Lwila was funded through
  the DAAD RISE Germany program. We analysed root surface area and biomass in soil samples collected from forest stands of different tree species compositions.
  This work was a part of a much larger study that spans several labs at the University of Goettingen; it aims to understand the ecosystem effects of
  inter-planting European Beech (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i>) with conifers (Douglas-fir and Norway Spruce (<i>Picea abies</i>)). If you're interested, you can read up on this project more <a href="https://www.uni-goettingen.de/en/574316.html"> here</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p>In summer 2018, I recieved a Diack Award from the Reed College Biology department to fund research with Dr. Ramirez on the effects of
  elevation and slope aspect on the drought physiology of bigcone Douglas-fir, a rare conifer endemic to
  the steep, arid mountains of Southern California's Transverse Range. You can read my research proposal <a href="2018_proposal.pdf"> here.</a> I presented my
  findings at the 2018 Reed Summer Research Poster Session; you can see my poster <a href="2018_poster.pdf"> here.</a> </p>
<p></p>
  In summer 2017, I worked for Dr. Keith Karoly in the Reed Herbarium as a part of the Marttala Memorial Fellowship.
  I learned to prepare, mount, and database herbarium specimens. Some of the finished specimens were placed in the Reed Herbarium, but most went to PSU.
  All of these specimens and more can be found online at the Consortium of Pacific Northwest Herbaria <a href="http://www.pnwherbaria.org/"> website.</a> </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h2>Journalism </h2>
<p> </p>
<p> As an undergraduate student, I spent three years working as an editor and writer for <i>The Reed College Quest</i>, the campus student-run newspaper that publishes weekly during the academic year.
  I worked with a team of student editors to recruit student writers, lead weekly writers' meetings, contribute articles, and edit and lay out the newspaper each week.
  Many of the articles that I wrote, from November 2018 onward, can now be found <a href = "https://reedquest.org/articles?author=5be478418a922ddc7214341a"> online. </a> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> I believe it is incredibly important to make scientific research accessible to non-scientists, and my experiences working at <i> The Reed College Quest </i> have helped me to develop skills in communicating concepts clearly and concisely.
  I plan to to use these skils to effectively communicate my own research to as broad an audience as possible. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h2>Science Outreach </h2>
<p> </p>
During my last two years at Reed, I worked as a student teacher through the <a href="https://www.reed.edu/biology/outreach/index.html"> Reed College Science Outreach Program. </a>
Together with my teaching teams of one to two other students, I planned and taught weekly lessons to fourth- and fifth-grade students at underfunded elementary schools in Portland.
These lessons focused on exploring basic scientific concepts, including the water cycle, food webs, and the greenhouse effect, through the lens of climate change.
I hope to be able to use my experiences teaching science through this program to be an even more effective teacher in the future. </p>
