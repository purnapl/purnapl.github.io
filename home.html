<p> Hi, I'm Purna. I graduated in 2020 from Reed Collge with a BA in Biology. My interests include ecology, botany, journalism, and science outreach. </p>

<h2>Research Experience </h2>
<p> </p>
<p>As a senior at Reed College, I spent two semesters working with Dr. Aaron Ramirez, Professor of Biology and Environmental Studies,
  to design and carry out an experimental undergraduate thesis. My thesis explored whether three species of trees native to the Pacific
  Northwest(Douglas-fir (<i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i>), Bigleaf Maple (<i>Acer macrophyllum</i>), and Coast Redwood (<i>Sequoia sempervirens</i>))
  are capable of absorbing water through their bark in order to reduce drought stress. If you're at all interested in my thesis work, you can read my
  thesis <a href="thesis.pdf"> here.</a> </p>
<p></p>
<p>I worked in the forestry department of the University of GÃ¶ttingen, Germany, for 12 weeks in summer 2019. My internship with PhD student Amani Lwila was funded through
  the DAAD RISE Germany program. We analysed root surface area and biomass in soil samples collected from forest stands of different tree species compositions.
  This work was a part of a much larger study that spans several labs at the University of Goettingen; it aims to understand the ecosystem effects of
  inter-planting European Beech (<i>Fagus syvatica</i>) with conifers (Douglas-fir and Norway Spruce (<i>Picea abies</i>)). If you're interested, you can read up on this project more <a href="https://www.uni-goettingen.de/en/574316.html"> here</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p>In summer 2018, I recieved a Diack Award from the Reed College Biology department to fund research with Dr. Ramirez on the effects of
  elevation and slope aspect on the drought physiology of Bigcone Douglas-fir (<i>Pseudotsuga macrocarpa</i>), a rare conifer endemic to
  the steep, arid mountains of Southern California's Transverse Range. You can read my research proposal <a href="2018_proposal.pdf"> here.</a> I presented my
  findings at the 2018 Reed Summer Research Poster Session; you can see my poster <a href="2018_poster.pdf"> here.</a> </p>
<p></p>
  In summer 2017, I worked for Dr. Keith Karoly in the Reed Herbarium as a part of the Marttala Memorial Fellowship.
  I learned to prepare, mount, and database herbarium specimens. Some of the finished specimens were placed in the Reed Herbarium, but most went to PSU.
  All of these specimens and more can be found online at the Consortium of Pacific Northwest Herbaria <a href="http://www.pnwherbaria.org/"> website.</a> </p>
