<h1 > <center> The Henhaus Cookbook </center> </h1>
<p> The approximate recipes for the best dinners (and a few other things) that I made over the past year. I know you guys don't like cooking as much as I do, but I thought you might like to try some of these! I'm going to really miss cooking for all of us. </p>

<h2>Pelmeni </h2>
<p> <i> From momsdish.com pelmeni recipe</i> </p>
<p> </p>

<p> <i>Dough </i>
<br>3 cups flour
<br>2/3 cup lukewarm water
<br>3 eggs
<br>1 teaspoon salt
</p>

<p><i>Filling</i>
<br>2 pounds ground beef
<br>1 large onion, grated
<br>1-2 teaspoons salt
<br>Pepper
</p>

<p><i>Topping</i>
<br>¼ cup siracha
<br>¼ cup white vinegar
<br>Butter
<br>Sour cream
<br>Curry powder
</p>

<p>Make the dough: combine all ingredients in a bowl and knead into a smooth dough. Cover with a damp towel or plastic bag and set aside at room temperature for at least 30 minutes.</p>

<p>Make the filling: combine all ingredients in a large bowl and mix well. Refrigerate while you let the dough rest.</p>

<p>When the dough is done resting, roll it out dough very thin (less than 1/8 of an inch). Cut out circles about 2-3 inches in diameter using a jar. Put a spoonful of filling in the middle, wet the edges, and fold over to create a half-circle. Connect the ends of the half moon to shape the pelmeni. </p>

<p>Cook the pelmeni in lightly salted simmering water; the pelmeni are cooked when they float to the surface (but you can cook them an extra 30 seconds to 1 minute after they float to the surface to be sure they are cooked). </p>

<p>Mix siracha and white vinegar together. Top pelmeni with a little bit of butter, curry powder, siracha-vinegar sauce, and sour cream. </p>

<h2>Eggplant Parmesan </h2>

<p>2-3 large eggplants
<br>Salt
<br>2 eggs, whisked with a few tablespoons of water
<br>Flour
<br>Breadcrumbs or panko
<br>Garlic powder
<br>Oregano, thyme, rosemary, sage, or a combination of all three, finely chopped or crushed
<br>Cayenne
<br>Parmesan
<br>Vegetable oil
<br>1 container ricotta
<br>Mozzarella, grated or finely chopped
</p>

<p>Slice eggplants thinly (1/8-1/4 inch thick) crosswise. Place eggplant circles in a single layer on cutting board or baking tray and sprinkle salt over them.
  Let sit at least 15 minutes, flip, and salt the other side. Let sit another 15 minutes, then rinse thoroughly. Dry off with a towel. </p>

<p>Heat about ½ inch vegetable oil in a frying pan. Mix breadcrumbs, crushed herbs, garlic powder, pepper, and parmesan. Dip each eggplant slice in flour.
  Shake off, then dip in egg and again in breadcrumb mixture. Fry until lightly brown on each side. Set aside.</p>

<p>Once all eggplant slices are fried, place them in single layer on the bottom of an oiled pan. Mix ricotta, crushed spices, garlic powder, pepper, parmesan, and salt.
  Spread ricotta mixture on top of eggplant slices in pan, add another layer of eggplant slices on top, and add a layer of tomato sauce on top of the eggplant.
  Repeat the layers: eggplant, ricotta, eggplant, tomato sauce, until you are out of eggplant slices. On top of the final layer of eggplant, add tomato sauce, mozzarella, parmesan, and herbs.
  Bake at 425F until the top is crispy, and serve alongside pasta.</p>

<h2>Pesto pasta salad with tomatoes, mozzarella, and chicken</h2>
<p></p>
<p>About 4-6 cups cooked short pasta (spirals, bowties, etc.)
<br>1-2 medium tomatoes (chopped), or ½-1 pint cherry tomatoes (halved)
<br>At least 5-6 small balls fresh mozzarella, quartered
<br>About ½ cup fresh pesto or slightly less jarred pesto (save empty pesto blender or jar for next step)
<br>Parmesan (optional)
<br>Salt (to taste)
</p>

<p><i>Pesto vinaigrette chicken</i></p>
<p>2-3 boneless chicken thighs, chopped into small (½ -1 inch) pieces
<br>3 cloves garlic, chopped
<br>Splash of olive oil
<br>Salt, to taste
<br>Pepper, to taste
<br>Everyday seasoning, to taste
<br>Garlic powder, to taste
<br>1-2 tablespoons lemon juice
<br>1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
</p>

<p>Cook the pasta. While it is cooking, chop the tomatoes, mozzarella, and chicken. Drain pasta and run cold water over it to cool it down, then mix with tomatoes, mozzarella, and pesto.</p>

<p>Heat a frying pan with a splash of oil or olive oil; when the oil is hot, add the chicken, garlic, and generous amounts of salt, pepper, everyday seasoning, and garlic powder. While the chicken is cooking, place lemon juice and balsamic in unwashed pesto blender or empty pesto jar; if you don’t have an empty unwashed pesto blender or jar, mix in about a tablespoon of pesto with the lemon juice and balsamic. Cap container and shake to blend pesto with lemon juice and vinegar (and clean container in the process!). When chicken is cooked, pour pesto vinaigrette mixture over chicken and turn off heat; the sauce will quickly reduce to coat the chicken.</p>

<br>1 teaspoon garam masala
<br>1 teaspoon cumin
<br>1 teaspoon curry powder (and/or ½ teaspoon each of coriander and turmeric)

<h2>Bao Buns</h2>
<p><i>From BBC News Bao Buns recipe</i><p>
<p></p>

<p>4 ¼ cups flour
<br>1-2 tablespoons sugar
<br>1 teaspoon yeast
<br>½ teaspoon salt
<br>¼ cup milk or soymilk
<br>1 ¼ cup water
<br>1 tablespoon oil
<br>1 tablespoon white vinegar
<br>1 teaspoon baking powder
</p>

<p>In a medium bowl, mix the flour, sugar, yeast, and salt together. Stir in water, milk, oil, and vinegar, and knead mixture into a dough, adding more water as necessary.</p>

<p>Turn the dough out on a lightly floured surface and knead at least 10 minutes, until smooth. Rise in an oiled bowl for 2-3 hours (depending on temperature), until doubled in size.</p>

<p>Punch down the dough and sprinkle the baking powder over it, then knead for a few minutes to combine. If you forget this step, the bao will still work! They might just be slightly less fluffy. </p>

<p>Divide dough into about 18 equally sized pieces, then roll each piece into a ball. Let the balls rest about 10 minutes, until gluten is relaxed and they are squishy and not firm.</p>

<p>Flatten each ball out into an oval about a finger-width thick, and fold the oval over on itself. This is how we’ll pry open the bao when it’s done. Place each folded bao onto a square of parchment or foil.</p>

<p>Let rise another 1-2 hours. Place a colander inside a large pot, and add 2-3 inches of water to the pot. When the water boils, add 3-5 bao on their parchment or foil squares, making sure that they are not too close together.
Steam 8 minutes, then remove and steam the next batch. Pry the buns open at the seam, add desired fillings (recommended: hoisin-soy sauce chicken and ginger-cabbage salad) and serve hot.</p>
<hr> <!-- this makes a horizontal line-->

<h2>Bao fillings</h2>

<p><i>Roast hoisin-soy sauce chicken or pork</i></p>
<p>¼ cup hoisin
<br>2 tablespoons ketchup (optional)
<br>1/3-1/2 cup soy sauce
<br>2-3 tablespoons brown sugar
<br>2-4 tablespoons white vinegar
<br>Chili paste (optional)
<br>2-3 cloves garlic, grated
<br>½ inch ginger, grated
<br>4-6 chicken thighs, or an approximately equal quantity of pork riblets
</p>

<p>Combine all ingredients except for the meat, taste, and adjust ingredient quantities to taste. Add the meat and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.</p>

<p>Preheat the oven to 375F. Roast chicken or pork until done; if desired, you can broil for a few minutes to blacken the top slightly. Let cool slightly, then chop into pieces and serve inside bao buns.</p>

<p><i>Shredded ginger cabbage-carrot salad</i></p>
<p>Cabbage, finely sliced
<br>Carrots, coarsely grated or thinly chopped
<br>Cilantro
<br>White vinegar
<br>Sesame oil

<br>Salt
<br>Black pepper
</p>

<p>Combine all ingredients in desired ratios, taste, and adjust. Top filled bao with cabbage salad and enjoy.</p>

<h2>Eggplant-Rice Noodle Stir Fry</h2>

<p><i>Tofu</i></p>
<p>1 block firm tofu
<br>At least 1 cup cornstarch
<br>Chili-lime powder
<br>Garlic powder
<br>Salt
<br>Vegetable oil
</p>

<p><i>Stir fry</i></p>
<p>1 medium-large eggplant, sliced into ½ inch chunks
<br>Salt
<br>6-8 brown mushrooms, sliced
<br>Rice noodles, preferably the wide ones
<br>Ginger, grated
<br>3-4 garlic cloves, chopped
<br>Soy sauce
<br>Brown sugar
<br>White vinegar
<br>Hot pepper sauce (sambal)
<br>Black pepper
</p>

<p>Salt the eggplant: place chopped eggplant in a large bowl, salt with a good quantity of salt, and let sit while you prepare the rest of the ingredients. </p>

<p>Set a pot of water to boil on the stove. When it boils, cook the rice noodles, drain, and set aside.</p>

<p>Fry the tofu: mix all the ingredients except tofu together in a small bowl.
  Slice tofu into chunks of the desired size, coat in cornstarch mixture, and fry in preheated vegetable oil; do not allow the tofu to touch in the pan or they will stick together.
  Flip when browned and crispy on the first side, allow to brown on the second side, and remove from the pan when fully crispy. Set aside.</p>

<p>Rinse the eggplant to remove as much of the salt as possible. Remove all but 1-2 tablespoons of oil from the tofu-frying pan. Once it’s hot, add the eggplant and cook until slightly browned on both sides and soft.
  Remove the eggplant, set aside, and add mushrooms. Once the mushrooms are cooked, add ginger, and garlic. Once the garlic starts to brown, add the noodles, fried tofu, cooked eggplant, and the rest of the ingredients.
  Stir everything together, taste, and adjust flavorings. Serve.</p>

<h2>Piecrust</h2>

<p>1 ½ cup flour (1 ¼ cup flour for flakier crust)
<br>2 tablespoons sugar
<br>10 tablespoons butter, cold
<br>Ice water
</p>

<p>Mix flour and sugar together. Combine with butter using either a grater (grate frozen butter into flour); a fork and knife (chopping into small pieces); or a blender (combine in blender).
  Add ice water as necessary to form a ball of dough, kneading as little as possible. Place dough ball in refrigerator in a plastic bag for at least an hour.</p>

<p>Roll dough out on lightly floured plastic-bag covered cutting board and use to line a piepan. There should be enough left for a thin top crust or strips to weave a lattice top crust. </p>
