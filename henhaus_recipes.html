<p> The approximate recipes for the best dinners (and a few other things) that I made over the past year. I know you guys don't like cooking as much as I do, but I thought you might like to try some of these! I'm going to really miss cooking for all of us. </p>

<h2>Pelmeni </h2>
<p> <i> From momsdish.com pelmeni recipe</i> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> <i>Dough </i></p>
<p>3 cups flour</p>
<p>2/3 cup lukewarm water</p>
<p>3 eggs</p>
<p>1 teaspoon salt</p>

<p>Filling</p>
<p>2 pounds ground beef</p>
<p>1 large onion, grated</p>
<p>1-2 teaspoons salt</p>
<p>Pepper</p>

<p><i>Topping</i></p>
<p>¼ cup siracha</p>
<p>¼ cup white vinegar</p>
<p>Butter</p>
<p>Sour cream</p>
<p>Curry powder</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Make the dough: combine all ingredients in a bowl and knead into a smooth dough. Cover with a damp towel or plastic bag and set aside at room temperature for at least 30 minutes.</p>

<p>Make the filling: combine all ingredients in a large bowl and mix well. Refrigerate while you let the dough rest.</p>

<p>When the dough is done resting, roll it out dough very thin (less than 1/8 of an inch). Cut out circles about 2-3 inches in diameter using a jar. Put a spoonful of filling in the middle, wet the edges, and fold over to create a half-circle. Connect the ends of the half moon to shape the pelmeni. </p>

<p>Cook the pelmeni in lightly salted simmering water; the pelmeni are cooked when they float to the surface (but you can cook them an extra 30 seconds to 1 minute after they float to the surface to be sure they are cooked). </p>

<p>Mix siracha and white vinegar together. Top pelmeni with a little bit of butter, curry powder, siracha-vinegar sauce, and sour cream. </p>
